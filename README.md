# PF-iCare

Group project about an online medical service.
This service has various functionalities for ease of use both for our clients and for our medical specialists.
The website has the possibility of registering as both a patient and a doctor, a dashboard where it will show information about the profile, the possibility of editing it, being able to book a medical appointment, request a medical emergency, buy a medical plan, talk to our administrators and the rest. The doctor will be able to attend emergencies, view pending appointments, see medical records of patients as well as view reviews about him.
On the other hand, the page has an administrator dashboard where you can register new doctors, new patients, delete reviews, register or modify medical plans, etc.

It is a very complete project that covers all points and perfectly replicates an online medical service.

If you have any concerns, do not hesitate to ask, enjoy it!
